# CleanArchitectureMR
This repository is made as an example of Clean Architecture Following Matthew Renze's
Pluralsight Course. It is still a _work in progress_ repository, where I will implement
an interpretation of the remaining functionality, as described in the course.

Some parts are already changed, such as the structure of different components, and especially
the organization of the Unit Tests; in the original solution the tests are in the same folders
as the units they are testing, compared to this solution, where the tests are in their own
projects.

I find Mathew's approach more suitable for small projects, where time to delivery is more
critical, compared to other Clean Architecture Examples.
